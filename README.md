# Crop-Disease-Detection-Using-Image-Classification

## Abstract
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for 
detecting rice plant diseases, specifically Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown 
Spot, and Leaf Smut, using image classification techniques. The model 
leverages a pre-trained DenseNet121 architecture to achieve high accuracy. 
The dataset consists of images of diseased and healthy rice leaves, which 
are preprocessed and used to train, validate, and test the model. The final 
model achieves an accuracy of [83]% on the validation 
set, demonstrating its potential for aiding farmers in early detection and 
treatment of rice plant diseases.

## Introduction
Rice is a staple food for over half of the world's population,  
making its cultivation crucial for global food security. However, 
rice plants are susceptible to various diseases that can significantly  
reduce yield and quality. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of  
these diseases are essential for effective management and control. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of  
detecting and classifying rice plant diseases from leaf images, 
providing a tool to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in  
disease management.

## Problem statement
Rice plant diseases, such as Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and 
Leaf Smut, pose a major threat to rice production. Traditional 
methods of disease detection rely on visual inspection by experts, 
which is time-consuming and prone to errors. There is a need for an 
automated, accurate, and efficient system to identify these diseases at 
an early stage to minimize crop loss and improve yield.
